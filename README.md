💡Inspiration
With rising food scarcity and food waste on the rise, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to get affordable, healthy, and locally sourced produce on the dinner table.

"Globally, 1.3 billion tonnes of edible food is wasted or lost every year."

⁠— Made In CA, 2023

This is becoming an ever-increasing problem as the population continues to increase while arable and fertile land continues to decrease.

“SharePlate” aims to solve this by allowing locals to barter or give away locally sourced food and produce that they may not need or have an excess of.

❓What it does
"Share Plate" is a peer-to-peer food bartering website that offers a sustainable and community-driven alternative to traditional supermarkets. Centred on locally sourced food, this platform is not merely about affordability; it's fundamentally about nurturing a robust sense of community and curtailing food waste. By enabling users to share or barter their surplus food within local communities, "Share Plate" fosters an environment of mutual support and connection. This initiative emphasizes the importance of sustainability and local engagement in our fast-paced modern world. It promotes a more communal and environmentally conscious approach to food consumption and distribution.

⚙️ How we built it
We're using ReactJS and Vite for our front-end Authentication is done through Firebase Our front-end is linked with MongoDB and NodeJS on the backend

💪 Challenges we ran into
Theming: It was a challenge creating a consistent UI for our users while working remotely
Linking the Front-End to the Back-End with only a few hours left
Adding multiple features in this small amount of time
No pizza since we were virtual 😢
👏 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating a fully functioning full-stack product that directly tackles the growing struggles of food scarcity!

We believe a bartering system for produce will also foster a great sense of community and is a good alternative to purchasing goods from a supermarket.

🧠 What we learned
Before this hackathon, we never realized how much of a problem food waste is becoming, especially with the rise of urbanization leading to fewer and fewer areas for farming. Through our research and work on “Share Plate”, we’ve learned more about the ecological and sustainable means of providing food to the world.

On a technical side, before this hackathon, none of us knew how to set up complete full-stack applications integrated with MongoDB, we’ve definitely learned a lot about working together as a team and creating professional products

🛣️ What's next for test
Although we’re incredibly happy with our results, we’re planning on implementing the following in the future:

Integrate an AI in the form page that will scan the photo sent, and auto generate a title, description, and possibly expiry date
It will also be a good method to filter unsafe content from the site
Give users “credits” after donating and interacting with the site; these credits can be used to get discounts at sustainable stores that we will partner with
Partner with charities and food banks to manage inventory
